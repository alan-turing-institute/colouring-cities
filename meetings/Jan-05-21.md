# Colouring cities kick off meeting 5th January 2021

## Proposed REG tasks

- Some more specific details than the below in [this issue](https://github.com/colouring-london/colouring-london/issues/680)
- Server VM setup/management
  - Review what has already been set up on 
  - Improve the automation of (re)provisioning a VM for London and prepare whole VM template for other cities.
- Automate CI/deployment pipelines:
  - Build and release from GitHub to staging/production through GitHub Actions (currently only a CI task is set up)
  - Think about some automation of database schema updates and better db migrations setup (currently all manual / git-based)
- Improve testing setup (currently only a few unit tests)
  - Help set up an integration testing environment/pipeline (would help greatly for automated dependency updates)
  - Help set up front-end testing 
- Tile server improvements - the tile server is a custom implementation in Node+Mapnik due to having to render building data visualisation as raster tiles because of OS licensing.
  - Review if possible to use a more off-the-shelf solution that would help with the below points, or
  - Improve tile cache control, build utilities for easier clearing of cache for selected layers, regions, etc
  - Add some request priority control, which would help with keeping the app smooth (as even things like building selection highlight is sent as raster, again due to OS limitations)
  - Build a way for less technical users to easily edit data map styles. Currently works by editing Mapnik XML files - sometimes hard even for programmers. E.g. look at whether it's possible to combine the raster tiles requirement with a style specification like the Mapbox JSON, which can be edited with GUI tools like Maputnik
